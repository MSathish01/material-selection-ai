You have a complete GenAI Material Selection Assistant project, but you need to:
1. Install the required software (Node.js, MongoDB)
2. Get API credentials (OpenAI, MongoDB)
3. Configure and run the application

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Phase 1: Install Prerequisites (30 minutes)

3. Click the big green button that says "Download Node.js (LTS)"
4. Run the downloaded installer
5. Click "Next" through all the steps (accept defaults)
6. **Important**: Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked
7. Click "Install" and wait for completion
8. **Restart your computer** (this is important!)

#### Action 1.2: Verify Node.js Installation
1. Open PowerShell (search for "PowerShell" in Windows)
2. Type: `node --version` and press Enter
3. You should see something like: `v20.10.0`
4. Type: `npm --version` and press Enter
5. You should see something like: `10.2.3`
6. If you see these version numbers, you're good! âœ…
7. If you see "command not found", restart your computer and try again

#### Action 1.3: Set Up MongoDB
**Choose Option A (Easier) or Option B (Advanced)**

**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended)**
1. Go to: **https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register**
2. Sign up with your email (it's free)
3. Verify your email
4. Click "Build a Database"
5. Choose "FREE" (M0 Sandbox) - don't pay anything!
6. Select a cloud provider (AWS is fine)
7. Choose a region close to you
8. Click "Create Cluster" and wait 3-5 minutes
9. Click "Database Access" in left menu
10. Click "Add New Database User"
11. Username: `materialuser`
12. Password: Create a strong password (write it down!)
13. Click "Add User"
14. Click "Network Access" in left menu
15. Click "Add IP Address"
16. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for testing)
17. Click "Confirm"
18. Go back to "Database" and click "Connect"
19. Choose "Connect your application"
20. Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://materialuser:...`)
21. Save this connection string - you'll need it! âœ…

**Option B: Local MongoDB (Advanced)**
1. Go to: **https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community**
2. Download MongoDB Community Server for Windows
3. Run the installer
4. Choose "Complete" installation
5. Install as a Windows Service
6. Your connection string will be: `mongodb://localhost:27017/material-selection`

#### Action 1.4: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/signup**
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/account/billing**
4. Add a payment method (credit card)
5. Add at least $5 credit (this will last a long time)
6. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
7. Click "Create new secret key"
8. Name it: "Material Selection App"
9. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
10. **Save this key securely** - you won't see it again! âœ…

### Phase 2: Configure the Project (10 minutes)

#### Action 2.1: Open Project Folder
1. Navigate to where you extracted/cloned the project
2. The folder should be named: `genai-material-selection-assistant`
3. Hold Shift and right-click in the folder
4. Choose "Open PowerShell window here"

#### Action 2.2: Check Prerequisites
In PowerShell, run:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File check-prerequisites.ps1
```

This will tell you what's missing. Fix any issues before continuing.

#### Action 2.3: Create Configuration File
In PowerShell, run:
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

#### Action 2.4: Edit Configuration
1. Open the `.env` file in Notepad:
   ```powershell
   notepad .env
   ```

2. Find this line:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key (the one starting with `sk-`)

3. Find this line:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/material-selection
   ```
   Replace it with your MongoDB connection string:
   - If using Atlas: `mongodb+srv://materialuser:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/material-selection?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
   - If using local: keep it as is

4. Save the file (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad

### Phase 3: Install and Run (15 minutes)

#### Action 3.1: Install Dependencies
In PowerShell (in the project folder), run:
```powershell
npm install
```

Wait for it to complete (may take 5-10 minutes). You'll see lots of text scrolling - this is normal.

#### Action 3.2: Install Backend Dependencies
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

#### Action 3.3: Install Frontend Dependencies
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

#### Action 3.4: Seed the Database
```powershell
cd backend
npm run seed
cd ..
```

You should see:
```
Connected to MongoDB
Cleared existing materials
Inserted 5 sample materials
Inserted 11 additional materials
Database seeded successfully with 16 total materials
```

If you see this, great! âœ…

#### Action 3.5: Start the Application
```powershell
npm run dev

Backend running on port 5000
Frontend running on port 3000
```

**Don't close this PowerShell window!** Keep it running.

3. Apply some filters (category, domain, etc.)
4. Click on a material to see details

#### Action 4.3: Chat with AI Assistant
1. Click "AI Assistant" in the sidebar
2. Try asking: "Find corrosion-resistant materials for offshore platforms"
3. See the AI recommendations

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Can't install Node.js
- Make sure you downloaded the correct version for Windows
- Run the installer as Administrator (right-click â†’ Run as administrator)
- Restart your computer after installation

### Problem: PowerShell says "execution policy"
Run this first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
- Double-check your connection string in .env
- For Atlas: Make sure you replaced `<password>` with your actual password
- For Atlas: Verify IP whitelist includes your IP
- For local: Check MongoDB service is running

### Problem: "OpenAI API error"
- Verify your API key in .env (should start with `sk-`)
- Check you have credits: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key

### Problem: "npm install" fails
Try this:
```powershell
npm cache clean --force
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

### Problem: Port already in use
```powershell
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill it (replace 1234 with actual PID)
taskkill /PID 1234 /F
```
